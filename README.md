# Sub-5-Second-Attention-Span-Gang
Orbital Project 2022

Motivation 

You used to be an avid reader as a kid, but now, staring at a page for more than 5 minutes feels like a chore. There are just better, more gratifying things to do with your very limited time now, like social media, Netflix, and anime. But what if there was a way to fuel an intrinsic need to finish that one novel you could never get through? What if this was the book that reignites your long-lost love for reading?

Losing interest in reading is far too common as we enter adulthood. We miss out on the numerous psychological benefits of reading, as well as its sheer joy. While many of us want to start reading again, we simply lack the drive to begin. Research shows that friends can play a major role in making us go to the gym more often (even when it feels like a chore, just like reading). Be it through inspiration or competitiveness, we want to make a platform for everyone to start reading together.



Aim 

We want to make a reading tracker where users can enjoy reading with others, share book reviews and thoughts, and feel rewarded for it. 


User Stories

Users can also start a book from the database(possibly using Google Books API) or input their own custom titles and record their progress in terms of number of pages. 
Users can record and save their annotations and thoughts at different pages.
Users can add other users and track their progress (eg. daily number of pages read, All-time number of titles read, number of pages for a particular title/series) in comparison with others.
Users can write book reviews, discuss fan theories etc. in forums or on their personal profile. They can also leave ratings out of 5 for the titles they have finished that all users can view.
Badges/Points/Achievements for reading more/engaging in forums more and for different levels of reading achievement (eg. First book read with over 500 pages, Over 200 titles read, Over 100 posts made on forums)
People can keep track of the books they have read and a map of the different genres and books they have read can be generated for reference.
Recommendations based on genres you’ve read before and user ratings.
Users can share their progress and reviews on other platforms like Instagram, Twitter and Telegram.
